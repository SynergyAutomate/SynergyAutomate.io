                    <h2 class="au-callout__heading">When you submit your request</h2>
                    <p>
                      The ‘scope’ of the request is ensuring you are as specific as possible when describing the documents or information to
                      help us quickly locate what you want to access, as it informs what system or area we need to go to for an answer.
                      Specific files and documents are more likely to be in an electronic format and easier to access quickly, if the
                      document type and reference numbers are provided.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      To assist the FOI Section in processing FOI requests quickly, we ask that you please consider how you word your
                      request:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>provide a scope (refer to our examples) – we often receive requests that have no scope at all</li>
                      <li>provide specific immigration history and which particular file/document is relevant in the first instance</li>
                      <li>
                        ensure that you provide specific details of the files that you are seeking to access – file numbers, date ranges,
                        full names and correct date of birth.
                      </li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>The more document information you share the better:</p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>Document reference numbers</li>
                      <li>[see list of ‘scope’ information’]</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>Avoid using non-specific language or broad terminology such as:</p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>“all visa files”</li>
                      <li>“all documents relating to the applicant”</li>
                      <li>“including but not limited to..”</li>
                      <li>“other such documents”</li>
                      <li>“and other relevant files”</li>
                      <li>“Anything that appears on the system under my name and DOB”</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                      Sending a vague request with missing ‘scope’ may add a substantial delay to the finalisation of your FOI request. This
                      is because the information may include paper files which may be stored across the country, and given the COVID-19
                      pandemic, currently accessing hard copies of files can be difficult.

                    <h3 class="au-display-xxl">Processing Times</h3>

                    <p>The Department will acknowledge receipt of an FOI access request within 14 calendar days of lodgement.</p>
                    <p>
                      The Department is required to give the client a decision about the request and the reasons for that decision within 30
                      days of lodgement of the request.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      If the Department needs to consult with anyone else, we have a further 30 days to inform the client of the decision –
                      for example, if the client asks for a document which contains information about a third party.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      If for any other reason the Department requires more than 30 days to complete the request, we will contact the client
                      to arrange an extension of time up to 30 calendar days for processing the request.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      The Department might also apply to the Australian Information Commissioner for an extension of the processing time
                      where exceptional circumstances would prevent us from processing the request in 30 days. The client will be informed
                      in writing if the processing time has been extended.
                    </p>
                    
                    <h3>Refused access</h3>
                    <p>We might refuse to give you access to documents under the FOI Act because they are exempt documents. 
                      Exempt documents include those where disclosure of the documents or the information in them:</p>

                      <ul><li>could reasonably be expected to prejudice an investigation</li>
    <li>could reasonably be expected to prejudice the proper administration of the law or the proper efficient conduct of our operations</li>
    <li>would involve the unreasonable disclosure of personal information of another person or constitute a breach in confidence</li>
    <li>is prohibited under other legislation -- for example, under the Migration Act secrecy provisions</li>
                        <li>is subject to legal professional privilege</li>
                       <li> is contrary to the public interest, and they are internal working documents</li>
                        <ul>
<p>Sometimes we might give you a document with the exempt material deleted. You will be provided with the reasons for the exemption and your review rights.</p>
