                    <p>
                      FOI cannot provide personal advice, explanations in relation to departmental matters or progress reports on
                      applications that are in process.

                  <p>The Department will acknowledge receipt of an FOI access request within 14 calendar days of lodgement.</p>

                  <p>
                    The Department is required to give the client a decision about the request and the reasons for that decision within 30
                    days of lodgement of the request.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    If the Department needs to consult with anyone else, we have a further 30 days to inform the client of the decision –
                    for example, if the client asks for a document which contains information about a third party.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    If for any other reason the Department requires more than 30 days to complete the request, we will contact the client to
                    arrange an extension of time up to 30 calendar days for processing the request.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    The Department might also apply to the Australian Information Commissioner for an extension of the processing time where
                    exceptional circumstances would prevent us from processing the request in 30 days. The client will be informed in
                    writing if the processing time has been extended.

                  <p>
                    We might decide to impose charges under the FOI Act for the time taken to process your application. This includes
                    charging for the time taken to search and retrieve the documents relevant to your request, the time taken to make a
                    decision on your request and the costs associated with photocopying and postage.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    No charge is payable on a document which contains your own personal information (but could be payable if your request
                    extends to documents which contain information other than your personal information).
                  </p>
                  <p>Under the FOI Act and regulations there is no charge for:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>making an application for access to a document</li>
                    <li>making an application for amendment or annotation or a personal record</li>
                    <li>making an application for internal review of a decision</li>
                    <li>making an application for review by the Information Commissioner</li>
                    <li>making a complaint to the Information Commissioner</li>
                    <li>providing access to personal information</li>
                    <li>providing access outside the statutory processing period unless that period has been extended.</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>
                    Fees and charges are set by the

                  <p>
                    We might refuse to give you access to documents under the FOI Act because they are exempt documents. Exempt documents
                    include those where disclosure of the documents or the information in them:

                    <li>could reasonably be expected to prejudice an investigation</li>

                      could reasonably be expected to prejudice the proper administration of the law or the proper efficient conduct of our

                    <li>

                    <li>is prohibited under other legislation -- for example, under the Migration Act secrecy provisions</li>
